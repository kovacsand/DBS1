## **Database Systems**  

DBS is a fun course teaching both the design and the maintenance/usage part of databases. The SQL part was more or less familiar from high school. On the other hand, the theory and practices behind an efficient relational database were undoubtedly profitable.

### *ECTS: 5*

### What I've learnt:
- Designing ER and GR diagrams
- Nomralise a database up to 3rd normal form
- SQL to create, replace, update and delete data

### Personal review:

Very practical course, with great course material and fun teacher.

  ### Knowledge  
   Having completed this course, students will be able to:
   • explain the relationship between relational algebra and SQL.  
   • explain the relational model.  
   • explain the 3 normal forms.  
   • explain keys in relational databases.   
   • explain joins.  
   • explain transactions.

  ### Skills  
  Having completed this course, students will be able to   
  • create ER Models with UML   
  • use Data Definition Language (DDL) to create databases  
  • use Data Modelling Language (DML) to manipulate data in a database   
  • use the mapping method to convert ER-Models to Relational Models   
  • use normalisation to normalise a database schema to 3rd normal form   
  • create SQL statements to create, replace, update and delete data in a database  
  • use keys in relational databases  
  • use joins  

  ### Competences  
  Having completed this course, students will be able to:
